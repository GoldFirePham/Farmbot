This is the farmbot respiratory.

Here you can find code for irrigation and taking photos

In the old_code_and_files folder you will find a old read.me by another student Suseel. And it tell you some stuff to replace like email and password if there is multiple farmbot(indoor and outdoor).

Files that contains the keywords "coor", are code that run in a coordinate based system. It will need a starting X and Y. And ending X and Y, and Z. And STEP_SIZE.

Files that contains the keywords "Group", are code that run by the groups that are created in the Farmbot. When run it will display a listed of group and you will type in a number for which groups you want.
